micro and macro
micro operation in react js
In React.js, understanding micro and macro operations is essential for optimizing performance and managing asynchronous tasks effectively.
Microtasks and macrotasks are two types of tasks in the JavaScript event loop that help manage asynchronous operations.
Microtasks:
Microtasks are tasks that are executed immediately after the currently executing script and before any rendering or I/O operations. They have a higher priority than macrotasks. Examples of microtasks include:
Promises: When a promise is resolved or rejected, the associated .then() or .catch() callbacks are added to the microtask queue.
Mutation Observers: These are used to watch for changes in the DOM and execute callbacks when changes occur.
Macrotasks:
Macrotasks, on the other hand, are tasks that are executed after the microtasks have been completed. They have a lower priority compared to microtasks. Examples of macrotasks include:
setTimeout and setInterval: These functions schedule tasks to be executed after a specified delay.
I/O Operations: Tasks related to network requests, file reading/writing, etc.
User Interactions: Events like clicks, key presses, etc., are handled as macrotasks
